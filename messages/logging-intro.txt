__**Logging**__

Logging is different in the main server, however, as a trial you are required to manually log everything.
All the formats are listed in the channels, or in the information channel.

The basic format is:
```Username:
Discord ID:
Moderation type:
Reason:
Proof:```

e.g.
 
```Username: AugustPeople#7399
Discord ID: 578197982961336320
Moderation Type: Mute & Warn
Reason: Directed Profanity
Proof: <insert image>```
