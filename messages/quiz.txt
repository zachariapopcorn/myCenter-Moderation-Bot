**Quiz section**
 
This section is dedicated to quizzing you, and you can have the handbook open as you do it.
Your time starts now, you will be timed to complete it. Make sure to read the questions fully.
 
When asked for a code, follow the instructions below:
- Say "I have completed section <NUM>, here is the code <CODE>"
Replace <NUM> with the section number, and <CODE> with the code you're prompted with.
e.g.
`I have completed section 1, here is the code: 123456`.
