**Welcome to your room, <@$1>!**
 
We're glad to have you here for our training, and congratulations on passing your application!
This training will be split into three parts:
- Quiz;
- Scenarios;
- Logging.
 
Our first section is the **quiz** section. Please react with a :thumbsup: when ready, and your trainer will purge this channel and give you the link, all the best of luck!
